## Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components, which are independent units of code that manage their own state and logic. This structure allows for easy reuse and enhances code maintainability.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a virtual representation of the DOM in memory, which makes updating and rendering more efficient by avoiding full-page reloads.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: JSX enables developers to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript, providing a clearer and more intuitive way to design and update the user interface.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React employs a one-way data flow, which simplifies tracking and debugging the application's state.
- **Rich Ecosystem & Community**: React boasts a vibrant ecosystem of libraries, tools, and a large community, making it easier to integrate with other technologies and find solutions to common development issues.
