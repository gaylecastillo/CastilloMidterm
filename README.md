## What is React JS?

- It can be used to develop web, mobile, and desktop applications, making it a flexible framework for cross-platform development. React Native, a framework built on React, is tailored for mobile app development, whereas React Desktop enables the creation of desktop applications using web technologies.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components, which are independent units of code that manage their own state and logic. This structure allows for easy reuse and enhances code maintainability.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a virtual representation of the DOM in memory, which makes updating and rendering more efficient by avoiding full-page reloads.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: JSX enables developers to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript, providing a clearer and more intuitive way to design and update the user interface.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React employs a one-way data flow, which simplifies tracking and debugging the application's state.
- **Rich Ecosystem & Community**: React boasts a vibrant ecosystem of libraries, tools, and a large community, making it easier to integrate with other technologies and find solutions to common development issues.

## Setting Up React JS

To start building a React app, follow these simple steps

1. Install Prerequisites

Before you can start using React, you need to install a couple of tools on your machine:

Install Node.js and npm
React requires Node.js and npm to work. Here's how you can install them:

Download Node.js:

Go to the official Node.js website [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
Download and install the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system.

2. Create a React Application
The easiest way to create a new React app is by using a tool called Create React App. It sets up everything you need to get started quickly.

Install Create React App (Optional): You don't need to install Create React App globally. You can use it directly with npx, which comes with npm.

3. Start the development server
Navigate to your project directory (cd my-app) and run npm start. This will open your app in the browser.

4. Start coding
Edit files in the src folder to build your React app.
